                padding: 5px;">The purpose of putting together these simple Python apps was to learn and continue to hone programming
                skills related to object-oriented functions, command-line interfaces, simple app frontends, web connections, and other
                miscellaneous competencies. I'm still new to Python intermediate level Python, but feel quite comfortable working through
                complex problems given time and the right resources. The applications below are done in tandem with lectures from a Udemy
                Python course (of which I am still in progress).</p>

            <h2 id="Apartment-Rent-Sharing"><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/WebsitePythonApps/tree/main/ApartmentRentSharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Rent Sharing Interface</a></h2>
                <p style="font-size: 22px; margin: 30px; text-align: center; padding-left: 150px; padding-right: 150px">This command-line interface serves the purpose of calculating the rent share of 
                roommates in an apartment based on the amount of time each has spent in the apartment that month. The users can input their basic information into
                the interface along with their share of time in the apartment in a given month, and the application will generate a simple PDF report detailing
                how much each roommate should owe on rent that month. The interface currently only supports two roommates, but can be easily updated to support more users.</p>

            <h2 id="Math-Painter-Game"><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/WebsitePythonApps/tree/main/MathPainterGame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Math Painter Game</a></h2>
                <p style="font-size: 22px; margin: 30px; text-align: center; padding-left: 150px; padding-right: 150px">The Math Painter Game allows the user to draw shapes (squares and rectangles)
                of various colors onto a canvas. The user is prompted to select starting coordinates for their shapes, along with parameters for the shapes
                dimensions. The user is allowed to draw as mainly shapes they desire within the specified confines of the canvas.</p>

            <h2 id="Photo-Searcher-Interface"><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/WebsitePythonApps/tree/main/PhotoSearcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photo Searcher App</a></h2>
                <p style="font-size: 22px; margin: 30px; text-align: center; padding-left: 150px; padding-right: 150px">The Photo Searcher App allows a user to view an image representing an input query.
                For instance, if a user were to query the word 'beach', an image of a beach would be displayed on the app screen. The app uses the wikipedia database
                module inherent to Python in order to run search queries. The app is quite rudimentary in its current form and only accepts single search queries at a time,
                but I am working towards expanding on this concept in the future once I have spent more time learning the language.</p>
