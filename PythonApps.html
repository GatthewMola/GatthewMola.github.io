                skill related to object-oriented functions, command-line interfaces, simple app frontends, web connections, and other
                miscellaneous competencies. I'm still new to Python intermediate level Python, but feel quite comfortable working through
                complex problems given time and the right resources. The applications below are done in tandem with lectures from a Udemy
                Python course (of which I am still in progress).</p>

                of various colors onto a canvas. The user is prompted to select starting coordinates for their shapes, along with parameters for the shapes
                dimensions. The user is allowed to draw as mainly shapes they desire within the specified confines of the canvas.</p>
