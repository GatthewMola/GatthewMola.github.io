    I’ve created this website to showcase the work I have completed thus far
    in the fields of economics/econometrics and SQL database management.
    While the PostgreSQL databases are recent projects, the research papers
    were completed throughout my college career, with the most recent
    completed in 2021. All three of the research papers are coded in R
    within RStudio. This website is also coded using R in the RMarkdown
    format.

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/AlumniNetworkDatabase.git">Hood
    College Men’s Lacrosse Alumni Network</a></h3>
    <p>The purpose of this database is to compile Hood College Men’s
    Lacrosse alumni data so that all past and future alumni have access to a
    network of professionals in multiple industries they are already
    familiar with. The database is was written in PostgreSQL within pgAdmin.
    The code is then copied over to VSCode to more easily link with a Git
    repository.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/OriolesDatabaseProject.git">Partial
    2023 Orioles Database</a></h3>
    <p>This database contains the hitting, pitching, and fielding stats for
    a number of players on the 2023 Baltimore Orioles roster. I created this
    database as an exercise to better hone my skills in table creation,
    value insertion, join methods, and indexing/pagination. Like the Alumni
    Network database, the Orioles database was created using PostgreSQL in
    pgAdmin. Completed code is transferred to VSCode for upload to Git
    repository.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline">R Statistical Analysis Research Papers</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left">I’ve done a lot of growing and learning in the three years these
    research papers were written. You’ll see in each that my understanding
    of economic concepts and the R language becomes more concrete and I’m
    better able to explain my methods of research. You’ll also notice within
    each of the repositories that I begin to develop better data diligence
    in terms of version control. For example, I can offer far more data for
    my most recent paper - including different Markdown drafts and data
    visualizations - than I can for my first paper (only the final draft of
    the most recent paper is included in the repository to avoid
    confusion).</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/Seminar-Research-Paper.git">The
    Effect of the Stringency of Environmental Regulations on Greenhouse Gas
    Emissions in Developing Countries - 4/12/2021</a></h3>
    <p>The purpose of my Economics Capstone paper was not only to display my
    knowledge of economic concepts and theories, but also to show my ability
    to seek out interesting research opportunities and determine the best
    methods to analyze them. Throughout the latter half of my college career
    I became very passionate about climate initiatives in government policy
    and their effects on the environment. This research paper is the
    culmination of that passion. I employed the use of omitted variable and
    multivariate pooled regressions with two-way fixed effects to understand
    the effect of environmental regulations in developing countries.
    Developing countries tend to support more pollution-producing industries
    than developed countries due to a lack of available carbon-capture
    technologies and/or lack the economic incentives to support cleaner
    forms of industry. Therefore, environmental regulations in these
    countries tend to have a greater impact on their respective
    environments. This paper aimed to determine this effect on ten different
    developing economies in multiple climates.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/Labor-Econ-Research-Paper.git">The
    Effect of Collective Bargaining Legislation on Public Sector Wages - A
    Literature Review and Cross-Sectional Study - 5/1/2020</a></h3>
    <p>Another great passion of mine in government policy is collective
    bargaining and the effects of unions in the private and government
    sectors. I come from a family of teachers who taught me that collective
    bargaining in the form of unions were their greatest asset when it came
    to promoting higher wages, increased benefits, and more comfortable work
    environments. It was not until I took Labor Economics and Indsutrial
    Organization my Junior year of college that I had the knowledge or the
    capability to understand how and why unions are able to support their
    workforces so effectively. This paper represents the concepts and
    methods I learned regarding collective bargaining and it’s ability to
    leverage worker sentiment to produce better results from contract
    negotiation (specifically in the public sector). For this paper, I also
    employed omitted variable and multivariate regressions, albeit
    significantly less complex versions than in the previous paper as this
    study was primarily one into the literature of the topic.</p>

    <div style="text-align:left" id="a-cross---sectional-study-on-the-effect-of-state-minimum-wage-on-youth-unemployment-at-the-state-level---12142019" class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/Econometrics-Research-Paper.git">A Cross-Sectional Study on the Effect of State Minimum Wage on Youth Unemployment at the State Level - 12/14/2019</a></h3>
    <p>Much in the same vain of the collective bargaining paper that follows it, 
    my very first econometrics paper analyzed the effect of wage minima instead of union influence on unemployment.
    </p>
    <p>I was heavily influenced by David Card and Alan Krueger's landmark 1995
    study on the effect of minimum wage changes between two states within the same metropolitan
    area (New Jersye and Pennsylvania-Philadelphia). Card and Krueger found that
    when New Jersey raised their state minimum wage higher than Pennsylvania,
    employment in New Jersey *rose* compared to that of Pennsylvania and 
    the Philadelphia area. It was theorized that workers in the Philadelphia area chose to employ themselves
    at the sae level in the neighboring New Jersey area as the wages had now increased.
    This method of exploiting a natural experiment intrigued me so much that I hypothesized
    the same effect across multiple states when examining youth unemployment alone.
    I theorized that youth unemployment would be more affected by changes in minimum
    wage as their inexperience and limited skillset generally forces them to rely on
    positions that only pay minimum wage.</p>
    <p>While my findings were unsurprisingly statistically insignificant, I learned a
    valuable lesson in my early college career that econometric theories and findings in 
    niche situations cannot always be extrapolated upon an outsized and far more variant dataset.
