        <h2 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline">R Statistical Analysis Research Papers</h2>
        <p style="text-align:left">I’ve done a lot of growing and learning in the three years these
        research papers were written. You’ll see in each that my understanding
        of economic concepts and the R language becomes more concrete and I’m
        better able to explain my methods of research. You’ll also notice within
        each of the repositories that I begin to develop better data diligence
        in terms of version control. For example, I can offer far more data for
        my most recent paper - including different Markdown drafts and data
        visualizations - than I can for my first paper (only the final draft of
        the most recent paper is included in the repository to avoid
        confusion).</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/Seminar-Research-Paper.git">The
        Effect of the Stringency of Environmental Regulations on Greenhouse Gas
        Emissions in Developing Countries - 4/12/2021</a></h3>
        <p>The purpose of my Economics Capstone paper was not only to display my
        knowledge of economic concepts and theories, but also to show my ability
        to seek out interesting research opportunities and determine the best
        methods to analyze them. Throughout the latter half of my college career
        I became very passionate about climate initiatives in government policy
        and their effects on the environment. This research paper is the
        culmination of that passion. I employed the use of omitted variable and
        multivariate pooled regressions with two-way fixed effects to understand
        the effect of environmental regulations in developing countries.
        Developing countries tend to support more pollution-producing industries
        than developed countries due to a lack of available carbon-capture
        technologies and/or lack the economic incentives to support cleaner
        forms of industry. Therefore, environmental regulations in these
        countries tend to have a greater impact on their respective
        environments. This paper aimed to determine this effect on ten different
        developing economies in multiple climates.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/Labor-Econ-Research-Paper.git">The
        Effect of Collective Bargaining Legislation on Public Sector Wages - A
        Literature Review and Cross-Sectional Study - 5/1/2020</a></h3>
        <p>Another great passion of mine in government policy is collective
        bargaining and the effects of unions in the private and government
        sectors. I come from a family of teachers who taught me that collective
        bargaining in the form of unions were their greatest asset when it came
        to promoting higher wages, increased benefits, and more comfortable work
        environments. It was not until I took Labor Economics and Indsutrial
        Organization my Junior year of college that I had the knowledge or the
        capability to understand how and why unions are able to support their
        workforces so effectively. This paper represents the concepts and
        methods I learned regarding collective bargaining and it’s ability to
        leverage worker sentiment to produce better results from contract
        negotiation (specifically in the public sector). For this paper, I also
        employed omitted variable and multivariate regressions, albeit
        significantly less complex versions than in the previous paper as this
        study was primarily one into the literature of the topic.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/GatthewMola/Econometrics-Research-Paper.git">A Cross-Sectional Study on the Effect of State Minimum Wage on Youth Unemployment at the State Level - 12/14/2019</a></h3>
        <p>Much in the same vain of the collective bargaining paper that follows it, 
        my very first econometrics paper analyzed the effect of wage minima instead of union influence on unemployment.
        </p>
        <p>I was heavily influenced by David Card and Alan Krueger's landmark 1995
        study on the effect of minimum wage changes between two states within the same metropolitan
        area (New Jersye and Pennsylvania-Philadelphia). Card and Krueger found that
        when New Jersey raised their state minimum wage higher than Pennsylvania,
        employment in New Jersey *rose* compared to that of Pennsylvania and 
        the Philadelphia area. It was theorized that workers in the Philadelphia area chose to employ themselves
        at the sae level in the neighboring New Jersey area as the wages had now increased.
        This method of exploiting a natural experiment intrigued me so much that I hypothesized
        the same effect across multiple states when examining youth unemployment alone.
        I theorized that youth unemployment would be more affected by changes in minimum
        wage as their inexperience and limited skillset generally forces them to rely on
        positions that only pay minimum wage.</p>
        <p>While my findings were unsurprisingly statistically insignificant, I learned a
        valuable lesson in my early college career that econometric theories and findings in 
        niche situations cannot always be extrapolated upon an outsized and far more variant dataset.
