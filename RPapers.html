                research papers were written. You’ll see in each that my understanding
                of economic concepts and the R language becomes more concrete and I’m
                better able to explain my methods of research. You’ll also notice within
                each of the repositories that I begin to develop better data diligence
                in terms of version control. For example, I can offer far more data for
                my most recent paper - including different Markdown drafts and data
                visualizations - than I can for my first paper (only the final draft of
                the most recent paper is included in the repository to avoid
                confusion).</p>

            Effect of the Stringency of Environmental Regulations on Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Developing Countries - 4/12/2021</a></h2>
                <p style="font-size: 22px; margin: 30px; text-align: left; padding-left: 80px; padding-right: 80px">The purpose of my Economics Capstone paper was not only to display my
                knowledge of economic concepts and theories, but also to show my ability
                to seek out interesting research opportunities and determine the best
                methods to analyze them. Throughout the latter half of my college career
                I became very passionate about climate initiatives in government policy
                and their effects on the environment. This research paper is the
                culmination of that passion. I employed the use of omitted variable and
                multivariate pooled regressions with two-way fixed effects to understand
                the effect of environmental regulations in developing countries.
                Developing countries tend to support more pollution-producing industries
                than developed countries due to a lack of available carbon-capture
                technologies and/or lack the economic incentives to support cleaner
                forms of industry. Therefore, environmental regulations in these
                countries tend to have a greater impact on their respective
                environments. This paper aimed to determine this effect on ten different
                developing economies in multiple climates.</p>

            The Effect of Collective Bargaining Legislation on Public Sector Wages - A Literature Review and Cross-Sectional Study - 5/1/2020</a></h2>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; margin: 30px; text-align: left; padding-left: 80px; padding-right: 80px">Another great passion of mine in government policy is collective
            bargaining and the effects of unions in the private and government
            sectors. I come from a family of teachers who taught me that collective
            bargaining in the form of unions were their greatest asset when it came
            to promoting higher wages, increased benefits, and more comfortable work
            environments. It was not until I took Labor Economics and Indsutrial
            Organization my Junior year of college that I had the knowledge or the
            capability to understand how and why unions are able to support their
            workforces so effectively. This paper represents the concepts and
            methods I learned regarding collective bargaining and it’s ability to
            leverage worker sentiment to produce better results from contract
            negotiation (specifically in the public sector). For this paper, I also
            employed omitted variable and multivariate regressions, albeit
            significantly less complex versions than in the previous paper as this
            study was primarily one into the literature of the topic.</p>

            A Cross-Sectional Study on the Effect of State Minimum Wage on Youth Unemployment at the State Level - 12/14/2019</a></h2>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; margin: 30px; text-align: left; padding-left: 80px; padding-right: 80px">Much in the same vain of the collective bargaining paper that follows it, 
            my very first econometrics paper analyzed the effect of wage minima instead of union influence on unemployment.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; margin: 30px; text-align: left; padding-left: 80px; padding-right: 80px">I was heavily influenced by David Card and Alan Krueger's landmark 1995
            study on the effect of minimum wage changes between two states within the same metropolitan
            area (New Jersye and Pennsylvania-Philadelphia). Card and Krueger found that
            when New Jersey raised their state minimum wage higher than Pennsylvania,
            employment in New Jersey *rose* compared to that of Pennsylvania and 
            the Philadelphia area. It was theorized that workers in the Philadelphia area chose to employ themselves
            at the sae level in the neighboring New Jersey area as the wages had now increased.
            This method of exploiting a natural experiment intrigued me so much that I hypothesized
            the same effect across multiple states when examining youth unemployment alone.
            I theorized that youth unemployment would be more affected by changes in minimum
            wage as their inexperience and limited skillset generally forces them to rely on
            positions that only pay minimum wage.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; margin: 30px; text-align: left; padding-left: 80px; padding-right: 80px">While my findings were unsurprisingly statistically insignificant, I learned a
            valuable lesson in my early college career that econometric theories and findings in 
            niche situations cannot always be extrapolated upon an outsized and far more variant dataset.
