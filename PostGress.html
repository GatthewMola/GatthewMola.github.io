        College Men’s Lacrosse Alumni Network</a></h3>
        <p>The purpose of this database is to compile Hood College Men’s
        Lacrosse alumni data so that all past and future alumni have access to a
        network of professionals in multiple industries they are already
        familiar with. The database is was written in PostgreSQL within pgAdmin.
        The code is then copied over to VSCode to more easily link with a Git
        repository.</p>

        2023 Orioles Database</a></h3>
        <p>This database contains the hitting, pitching, and fielding stats for
        a number of players on the 2023 Baltimore Orioles roster. I created this
        database as an exercise to better hone my skills in table creation,
        value insertion, join methods, and indexing/pagination. Like the Alumni
        Network database, the Orioles database was created using PostgreSQL in
        pgAdmin. Completed code is transferred to VSCode for upload to Git
        repository.</p>
